# This is a codebook for the 'Getting and Cleaning Data Assignment'

## Objective of the assignment

The purpose of the assignment is to demonstrate our ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The data given is for an experiment carried out on 30 subjects while they performed any of the six activities (WALKING, WALKING Upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, laying) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using the sembedded accelerometer and gyroscope, a variety of readings related to the acceleration and movements of the subjects. After applying various filters, for each record in the data the following are provided:
  - Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
  - Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
  - A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
  - Its activity label. 
  - An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.\

The obtained data is divided into two sets: 
  + training set with 70% data
  + testing set with 30% data
