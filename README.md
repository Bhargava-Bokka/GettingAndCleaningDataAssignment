# Getting And Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of the assignment is to demonstrate our ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The data given is for an experiment carried out on 30 subjects while they performed any of the six activities (WALKING, WALKING Upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, laying). 
* The obtained data is divided into two sets: 
  + training set with 70% data
  + testing set with 30% data
